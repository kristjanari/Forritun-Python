A bride who married in a lavish Chechen wedding in Moscow over
the weekend needed 32 designer label bags and suitcases costing almost a
quarter of a million pounds in which to fit her dowry, according to reports.
Student Ayna Dzabrailova, 22, the niece of controversial tycoon Umar Dzabrailov,
wore two wedding dresses with an estimated price of £350,000.
Some 600 guests attended the nuptials and the bride was seen packing
her dowry into 32 Louis Vuitton, Etro and Versace bags and suitcases which alone were reported to cost a staggering £230,000.
This was before the cost of the vast dowry itself. While it is unknown 
what is in the dowry it is thought that it was a selection of gifts rather than cash.
Ayna's uncle Umar Dzhabrailov, 60, a controversial tycoon and ex-Moscow 
senator, was fined £5,800 last year after he shot a Yarygin pistol in the 
air at the Four Seasons Hotel, close to the Kremlin.
