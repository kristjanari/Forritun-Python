Meghan Markle wore a figure-hugging dress showing her baby bump today and said she and Prince Harry can't wait to be parents, declaring: 'We're ready! We're excited to join the club'.
The royal couple have already taken Australia by storm as they started their historic first international tour together also taking in New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over the next 16 days.
Meghan and Harry have sparked a whirlwind by announcing they are having their first child just hours after touching down in Sydney.
They had told the Queen and the rest of the royal family their happy news at Princess Eugenie's Windsor Castle wedding on Friday before boarding a commercial flight to Australia via Singapore over the weekend.
The Duke and Duchess have been greeted by huge crowds desperate to see them and congratulate them about their baby, who will be seventh in line to the throne and is due in late April next year.
Today - the first full day of their tour - culminated in a Sydney reception at the grand Admiralty House overlooking the city's opera house where Meghan said she and her husband are 'excited' about becoming parents.
Meghan, who wore butterfly earrings and a gold bracelet belonging to Harry's mother Diana, spoke to Australian TV personality Eddie Woo, 33, at a reception and conversation turned towards parenthood.
When he said that his own children - aged five, seven and 10 - require 'a lot of energy', she replied: 'We're ready! We're excited to join the club'. 
Harry then told guests: 'Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome and the chance to meet so many Aussies from all walks of life. And we also genuinely couldn't think of a better place to announce the upcoming baby, be it a boy or a girl.'
